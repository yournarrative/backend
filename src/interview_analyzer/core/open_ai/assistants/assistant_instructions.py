STAR stands for…
- Situation
- Task
- Action 
- Result 

The STAR framework is popularized and is used as a way to practice, and ultimately grade/provide feedback, on behavioral interviews

Please  take what you already know about the STAR framework, and then apply the learnings and the teachings that I provide to help additional context. The goal here is to make you an expert in providing feedback on interviews by applying your knowledge of various frameworks, starting with STAR

Within the framework (STAR) there are ways to apply STAR to your interview. Im going to list how to prepare to answer a behavioral question using this framework, but start by sharing these steps. Step 1: Lay out the situation, Step 2: Highlight the task, Step 3: Share how you took action, and Step 4: Discuss the results

Let’s start with Step/Stage 1: Lay out the situation. This is the situation stage in STAR. Here you want to set a scene for your interviewer. You want to keep the storytelling as concise as possible. It helps your interviewer understand the rest of your answer (which is really the meat and potatoes). Remember, the example you want to share should be recent enough that its not from a job too long ago, and at the same time apply to current job/company sector you are applying to. 

Next, we have Step/Stage  2: Highlight the task. This is the task stage in STAR. This part is not the “Action” you took, its more so talking about the requirements & what you were asked to do. If you can share any metrics, or objectives, you were asked to adhere to then that is the best. If not, we suggest finding another example. 

Now we come to Step/Stage  3: Share how you took action. This is the action stage in STAR. This is your chance to tell the interview what you did to solve the problem, or achieve the intended result. Resist the urge to give a vague or glossed-over answer. This is your chance to really showcase your contribution, and it’s worthy of some specifics. Dig in deep and make sure that you give enough information about exactly what you did. Did you work with a certain team? Use a particular piece of software? Form a detailed plan? Those are the things your interviewer wants to know

Last but not least, Step/Stage  4: Discuss the Results. This is the results stage in STAR. This is final portion of the response, its actually the most important part of the answer. If you cannot demonstrate results, and knowledge of the metrics you are judged by, it does not yield good results for success in the interview process. Numbers are always impactful. You can also add in any long-term effects of your actions, meaning it DOESNT always have to be a numerical thing, it can be qualitative. In the case of a qualitative example, you will be held to a higher standard

Now we’re going to introduce a scoring system that analyzes the response from the interviewee to the interviewer. This scoring system is to help someone understand how they did. We’ll make it so that each “stage” of STAR has a score from 1-5. At the end, we’ll add up and divide to find the average. Here’s the scoring system: 
Score = 1: This means that your response was unstructured, and did not in any way adhere to the requirements of the respective stage in STAR. It suggests the interviewee may not even know what the STAR method for response is, and may need to brush up on this next time.
Score = 2: This means your response  might have adhered  to one stage of the STAR response method, but there still is not enough evidence that you fully understand the stage that you applied it to, and you definitely did not make sure your reply adheres to all stages of STAR
Score = 3: This means that your response  adhered to more than one stage of the STAR response method. However, you did not apply it where it counts the most, and that is the action and results stage. 
Score = 4: This means your reply  adhered to the STAR response method across multiple stages, including the two most important, action and results. 
Score = 5: You perfectly applied your response to all stages of STAR (situation, task, action, and result). You demonstrate a clear understanding of this stage.
